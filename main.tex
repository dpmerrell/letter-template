% The material below is a whole big dang thing whose purpose is just to set up a fixed coordinate system for \tikz so that you can put the Department or School address in the upper right-hand side without it moving all around every time you change something in the page.  I think it works.
% Defining a new coordinate system for the page:
%

% |(-1,0)    (0,0)    (1,0)|
% |                        |
% |(-1,-1)   (0,-1)  (1,-1)|

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Signature line  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Set your signature line here.
% One can add a signature image in a PDF file using the following code; this requires a file called "signature_block.pdf" to be installed in the same folder as the .tex file.  The vertical spacing (\vspace) and the scaling will have to be adjusted to get things to look correct for your particular signature image. Alternatively, comment out the following line in favor of the one labeled "[[Alternate]]" if you want to sign a paper copy of the letter.
%

% \signature{

\signature{\name}  % [[Alternate]]

% This block sets up the address on the right-hand side of the header.

% The following lines just compile the information you set up into the LaTex letter variable "address" for later use.

%%%%%%%%%%%  DATE  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% If you want a date different from the current date, comment out the next line in favor of the line labeled "[[Alternate]]".  The ``\vspace{10mm}'' just moves the date down a tiny bit so it doesn't interfere with the header.  This can be adjusted to your preference.

% This line sets up the return address to the right-side of the OSU logo.  The location is set with absolute node addresses using ``\tikz''.  It can still be a bit fussy, and you may need to alter this a little to get things to look right.  The bit that changes the position are the numbers in parentheses ``at (14.2,2.7)''

% The ``\lipsum[1-8]" command just fills the letter with 8 paragraphs of Latin for the purposes of filler.  Unless you really want to send filler Latin to someone, you will replace this command with actual text.  Do that here:

We are submitting our manuscript ``A Markov Decision Process for Response-Adaptive Randomization in Clinical Trials'' for your consideration as a research article in \textit{Computational Statistics and Data Analysis}. 
The manuscript is available on \texttt{arXiv} at \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14642}{https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14642}.
We originally submitted this work to \textit{Biostatistics}; 
it impressed editors there, but they felt it wasn't a good match for the scope of their journal. 
We suspect CSDA will be a better fit.

There has long been a desire to design clinical trials that both \textit{(i)} attain high statistical power and \textit{(ii)} assign more patients to better treatments.
A variety of techniques have been proposed to do this.
Our work presents \textsc{TrialMDP}, a dynamic programming algorithm that designs trials which \emph{adapt} in response to patient outcomes.
\textsc{TrialMDP} contains noteworthy innovations over related works:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It designs blocked trials whose randomization ratio \emph{and} block size may adapt over the course of the trial;
    \item it uses an objective function that explicitly controls the tradeoff between statistical power and patient outcomes.
\end{itemize}


We rigorously evaluate \textsc{TrialMDP} via simulation studies.
We find that its trial designs succeed in assigning more patients to superior treatments without compromising too much statistical power, relative to a suite of baseline designs.
In some cases, \textsc{TrialMDP} attains higher statistical power \emph{and} superior patient outcomes.
However, we are careful to describe the limitations of \textsc{TrialMDP}---computational cost being the primary example.

We put great care into making our code available and usable.
We provide an \textsc{R} package for \textsc{TrialMDP} at \href{https://github.com/dpmerrell/TrialMDP}{https://github.com/dpmerrell/TrialMDP}.
We also take pains to make our analyses completely reproducible, with a \textsc{Snakemake} workflow available at \href{https://github.com/dpmerrell/TrialMDP-analyses}{https://github.com/dpmerrell/TrialMDP-analyses}.
The workflow generates all results presented in the paper.

We hope this manuscript receives due consideration.
It presents a novel technique for adaptive trial design, and a careful evaluation of its performance.
It also serves as a positive example of reproducible computational research.
